# Email Viewer App

## Overview
This project is a simple email client application built to emulate the core functionalities of an email client like Outlook. It allows users to view a list of emails, read individual email details, mark emails as favorites, and filter emails by their status (read, unread, and favorite). The app uses a master-detail layout to render the email list on the left and display the selected email's body on the right.
